## Setup & Configuration

### Seller Setup

This application requires a specific configuration for stores, channels, and product selections:

1. **Store Creation**:
   - Create a store in commercetools with a unique key (e.g., `seller-store-1`)
   - The store key is used as the identifier for all seller-related operations

2. **Channel Alignment**:
   - Create a distribution channel with the same key as the store
   - Associate this channel with the store
   - Ensure the channel has roles of "InventorySupply" and "ProductDistribution"
   - This alignment is essential for proper pricing and product distribution

3. **Product Selection Setup**:
   - Create a product selection with the same key as the store
   - This alignment of keys (store, channel, product selection) is essential

4. **Product Variant Configuration**:
   - The application manages pricing exclusively through the master variant
   - All channel-specific prices are attached to the master variant
   - This approach simplifies price management while allowing seller-specific pricing

### Seller Association

Sellers (customers who manage stores) are not directly assigned to stores in this implementation. Instead:

1. **Custom Type Requirements**:
   - Create a custom type for customers named `seller-store-association`
   - Add a field named `store-key` of type String to this custom type
   - Label: "Store Key", Required: No

2. **Customer Configuration**:
   - Apply the custom type to seller customer records
   - Set the `store-key` field to match the store key they should manage

3. **Authentication Flow**:
   - When a seller logs in, the application reads this custom field
   - If valid, the seller is granted access to manage that store

### Business Unit Integration

The application employs a sophisticated business unit selection mechanism:

#### Customer-Based Business Unit Discovery
- Business units are fetched based on the customer ID of the logged-in user
- Uses GraphQL query with `associates(customer(id="..."))` filter
- No hardcoded business unit IDs required in the codebase

#### Multiple Business Units Support
- Automatically handles scenarios where a customer is associated with multiple business units
- Dropdown selector for choosing between business units
- Preserves selection between sessions for consistent user experience
- Automatically selects the first business unit by default

#### Store Context Handling
- Each business unit is associated with specific stores in the commercetools platform
- When a business unit is selected, the system fetches its associated stores
- The first store is automatically set as the active store in the auth context
- This active store context is used by all other components for queries and mutations

#### Technical Implementation
- React context-based architecture:
  - `business-unit-context.tsx` manages business unit state
  - `auth-context.tsx` handles store selection and propagation
- Custom hook (`useCustomerBusinessUnits`) that manages the business unit lifecycle
- GraphQL integration for real-time data fetching
- Performance optimizations:
  - Memoized business unit options
  - State update batching to prevent unnecessary renders
  - Store information caching to reduce API calls

### Business Unit as Seller Data Container

The business unit structure serves as the container for seller-specific information, enabling robust extensibility:

- Payment gateway credentials (e.g., Stripe account IDs)
- Shipping provider account information 
- Commission rates and payment terms
- Seller contact and support details

**Custom Type Framework**:
- Business units are extended with a `seller-store-configuration` custom type
- This type can be expanded with any field needed for seller operations
- Provides structured data storage with appropriate typing

**Data Access Pattern**:
- The `useCustomerBusinessUnits` hook provides a centralized access point
- Handles authentication, authorization, and data validation
- Maintains proper state management throughout the application

#### Adding New Seller Capabilities

To extend business units with new seller functionality:

1. Add necessary custom fields to the `seller-store-configuration` type
2. Update the configuration form to capture the new data
3. Integrate the new fields with relevant application features

This extensible approach enables the platform to rapidly adapt to different business models and seller requirements without requiring core application changes.
