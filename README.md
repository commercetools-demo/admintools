  - Implementation details:
    ```graphql
    # GraphQL search query structure
    query ProductSearch($text: String, $filter: [SearchFilterInput!]) {
      productProjectionSearch(
        markMatchingVariants: true
        text: $text
        filters: $filter
        locale: "en-US"
        limit: 20
        fuzzy: true
      ) {
        results {
          id
          nameAllLocales {
            locale
            value
          }
          masterVariant {
            sku
            images {
              url
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

- **Product Creation**:
  - Form-based interface for creating new products
  - Image URL preview functionality
  - Automatic addition to the store's product selection
  - Proper implementation of commercetools' money format:
    ```graphql
    prices: [{
      value: {
        centPrecision: {
          currencyCode: "USD",
          centAmount: 1000
        }
      }
    }]
    ```

- **Price Management**:
  - Channel-specific pricing for products in a seller's store
  - Clear visual indication of products with and without pricing

### Promotion Management
- Create and manage store-specific product discounts
- Support for percentage and fixed amount discount types
- Apply discounts to all products or specific products with conditions:
  - Filter by SKUs or categories
- Combine multiple conditions with AND logic
- Channel-specific filtering for seller's products
- Status management with toggle controls for activation/deactivation
- Editing capabilities with pre-populated forms and field comparison
- Bulk actions (activate, deactivate, delete)

### Business Unit Integration

The application employs a sophisticated business unit selection mechanism:

#### Customer-Based Business Unit Discovery
- Business units are fetched based on the customer ID of the logged-in user
- Uses GraphQL query with `associates(customer(id="..."))` filter
- No hardcoded business unit IDs required in the codebase

#### Multiple Business Units Support
- Automatically handles scenarios where a customer is associated with multiple business units
- Dropdown selector for choosing between business units
- Preserves selection between sessions for consistent user experience
- Automatically selects the first business unit by default

#### Store Context Handling
- Each business unit is associated with specific stores in the commercetools platform
- When a business unit is selected, the system fetches its associated stores
- The first store is automatically set as the active store in the auth context
- This active store context is used by all other components for queries and mutations

#### Technical Implementation
- React context-based architecture:
  - `business-unit-context.tsx` manages business unit state
  - `auth-context.tsx` handles store selection and propagation
- Custom hook (`useCustomerBusinessUnits`) that manages the business unit lifecycle
- GraphQL integration for real-time data fetching
- Performance optimizations:
  - Memoized business unit options
  - State update batching to prevent unnecessary renders
  - Store information caching to reduce API calls

This approach makes the application more flexible and maintainable by eliminating hardcoded references and supporting a wider range of business scenarios where sellers might be associated with multiple business units.

## Configuration Requirements

### Seller Setup

This application requires a specific configuration for stores, channels, and product selections:

1. **Store Creation**:
   - Create a store in commercetools with a unique key (e.g., `seller-store-1`)
   - The store key is used as the identifier for all seller-related operations

2. **Channel Alignment**:
   - Create a distribution channel with the same key as the store
   - Associate this channel with the store
   - Ensure the channel has roles of "InventorySupply" and "ProductDistribution"
   - This alignment is essential for proper pricing and product distribution

3. **Product Selection Setup**:
   - Create a product selection with the same key as the store
   - This alignment of keys (store, channel, product selection) is essential

4. **Product Variant Configuration**:
   - The application manages pricing exclusively through the master variant
   - All channel-specific prices are attached to the master variant
   - This approach simplifies price management while allowing seller-specific pricing

### Seller Association

Sellers (customers who manage stores) are not directly assigned to stores in this implementation. Instead:

1. **Custom Type Requirements**:
   - Create a custom type for customers named `seller-store-association`
   - Add a field named `store-key` of type String to this custom type
   - Label: "Store Key", Required: No

2. **Customer Configuration**:
   - Apply the custom type to seller customer records
   - Set the `store-key` field to match the store key they should manage

3. **Authentication Flow**:
   - When a seller logs in, the application reads this custom field
   - If valid, the seller is granted access to manage that store

## Business Unit Configuration

The business unit structure serves as the container for seller-specific information, enabling robust extensibility:

### Business Unit as Seller Data Container

The application leverages business units to store crucial seller-specific information:
- Payment gateway credentials (e.g., Stripe account IDs)
- Shipping provider account information 
- Tax configuration settings
- Commission rates and payment terms
- Seller contact and support details
- Operating hours and availability settings

### Implementation Architecture

- **Custom Type Framework**:
  - Business units are extended with a `seller-store-configuration` custom type
  - This type can be expanded with any field needed for seller operations
  - Provides structured data storage with appropriate typing

- **Flexible GraphQL Integration**:
  - Complete GraphQL mutation support for all custom fields
  - Automatic handling of different update scenarios (create/update)
  - Proper versioning to prevent concurrent modification issues

- **Data Access Pattern**:
  - The `useCustomerBusinessUnits` hook provides a centralized access point
  - Handles authentication, authorization, and data validation
  - Maintains proper state management throughout the application

### Adding New Seller Capabilities

To extend business units with new seller functionality:

1. Add necessary custom fields to the `seller-store-configuration` type
2. Update the configuration form to capture the new data
3. Integrate the new fields with relevant application features

This extensible approach enables the platform to rapidly adapt to different business models and seller requirements without requiring core application changes.
