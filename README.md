## Configuration Requirements

### Store Setup

This application requires a specific configuration for stores, channels, and product selections:

1. **Store Creation**:
   - Create a store in commercetools with a unique key (e.g., `seller-store-1`)
   - The store key is used as the identifier for all seller-related operations

2. **Channel Alignment**:
   - Create a distribution channel with the same key as the store
   - Associate this channel with the store
   - Ensure the channel has roles of "InventorySupply" and "ProductDistribution"
   - This alignment is essential for proper pricing and product distribution

3. **Product Selection Setup**:
   - Create a product selection with the same key as the store
   - This alignment of keys (store, channel, product selection) is essential

4. **Product Variant Configuration**:
   - The application manages pricing exclusively through the master variant
   - All channel-specific prices are attached to the master variant
   - This approach simplifies price management while allowing seller-specific pricing

### Customer Association

Sellers (customers who manage stores) are not directly assigned to stores in this implementation. Instead:

1. **Custom Type Requirements**:
   - Create a custom type for customers named `seller-store-association`
   - Add a field named `store-key` of type String to this custom type
   - Label: "Store Key", Required: No

2. **Customer Configuration**:
   - Apply the custom type to seller customer records
   - Set the `store-key` field to match the store key they should manage

3. **Authentication Flow**:
   - When a seller logs in, the application reads this custom field
   - If valid, the seller is granted access to manage that store

## UI Design Patterns

The application implements consistent UI patterns across all features to ensure a cohesive user experience:

### Enhanced Search Experience

The application features an optimized search user experience across product and price management:

- **Persistent Table During Search**:
  - Tables remain visible during active searches, maintaining context
  - Semi-transparent overlay with loading indicator provides visual feedback
  - Prevents disruptive UI shifts when performing searches
  - Implemented in both Product Management and Price Management

- **Search Field Optimization**:
  - Width-constrained search fields (600px maximum) for better visual balance
  - Properly debounced search to prevent excessive API calls
  - Immediate visual feedback for search operations

- **Table Rendering Improvements**:
  - Eliminated horizontal scrollbars with `overflow: hidden`
  - Optimized column width distribution (percentages add up to 100%)
  - Enhanced cell styling with proper overflow handling
  - Fixed image dimensions for consistent presentation
  - Added responsive horizontal scrolling for small screen support

- **CSS Refinements**:
  - Table container improvements to ensure proper width distribution
  - Box-sizing rules for consistent column rendering
  - Text overflow handling for long content in cells
  - Mobile-responsive adjustments for smaller screens

These UI enhancements create a more stable, responsive interface that maintains context during searches, reducing user confusion and providing clearer visual feedback throughout the application.

### Header Components

All section headers follow a consistent structure with:
- **Left Section**: Contains the title and navigation elements
  - Title (Text.Headline)
  - Back button (when applicable)
  - Context information (store/channel key)
- **Right Section**: Contains action buttons and controls
  - Primary actions (Add, Create, etc.)
  - Secondary actions (Refresh, Filter, etc.)

Example header implementation:
```jsx
<div className={styles.header}>
  <div>
    <Text.Headline as="h1">{sectionTitle}</Text.Headline>
    <Text.Subheadline>
      Store: <span className={styles.storeKeyHighlight}>{storeKey}</span>
    </Text.Subheadline>
  </div>
  <Spacings.Inline scale="s">
    <PrimaryButton
      label="Action" 
      onClick={handleAction}
      iconLeft={<PlusIcon />}
    />
  </Spacings.Inline>
</div>
```

### Form Patterns

Forms follow a card-based sectional layout:
- Each logical group of fields is contained in a separate Card component
- Section titles use consistent Text.Subheadline styling
- Consistent spacing (scale="m" for sections, scale="s" for fields)
- Standard field validation patterns with clear error messages
- Consistent button placement (Cancel on left, Submit on right)

Example form section:
```jsx
<Card>
  <Spacings.Stack scale="m">
    <div className={styles.sectionTitle}>
      <Text.Subheadline as="h4">Section Title</Text.Subheadline>
    </div>
    <Spacings.Stack scale="s">
      <TextField
        title="Field Label"
        value={value}
        onChange={handleChange}
        isRequired
        horizontalConstraint="scale"
      />
    </Spacings.Stack>
  </Spacings.Stack>
</Card>
```

### Data Tables

All data tables follow these patterns:
- Consistent column definitions with standardized cell formatters
- Unified selection behavior (checkbox in first column)
- Standard actions placement (right-aligned in the last column)
- Consistent loading and empty states
- Standardized pagination controls

### Modal Patterns

Modals follow a consistent implementation:
- Standardized header with title and close button
- Content area with proper padding and scrolling behavior
- Footer with consistently placed action buttons
- Size appropriate to content (small, medium, large)

## Error Handling

The application implements a comprehensive error handling strategy across all components:

### API Error Handling
- GraphQL error extraction and formatting for user-friendly display
- Network error detection and appropriate messaging
- Detailed error logging in the console for debugging

### Form Validation
- Field-level validation with immediate feedback
- Form-level validation before submission
- Clear error messages with actionable guidance

### Optimistic UI Updates
- Temporary state updates before API confirmation
- Rollback on error with appropriate notifications
- Loading indicators during async operations

### Error Presentation
- Consistent use of ContentNotification components for errors
- Contextual error messages based on operation type
- Different visual treatments for warnings vs. critical errors

Example error handling implementation:
```jsx
try {
  // API operation
  const result = await apiCall();
  setSuccessMessage("Operation completed successfully");
} catch (error) {
  // Error handling
  if (error.graphQLErrors?.length > 0) {
    const messages = error.graphQLErrors.map(err => err.message).join(", ");
    setError(`API Error: ${messages}`);
  } else if (error.networkError) {
    setError("Network error. Please check your connection and try again.");
  } else {
    setError(`Unexpected error: ${error.message}`);
  }
} finally {
  setLoading(false);
}
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Logging Control

The application implements a centralized logging utility to optimize performance and reduce console clutter in production:

- **Logging Utility**: Located in `src/utils/logger.ts`
- **Environment-Aware**: Automatically detects development vs. production environments
- **Log Levels**: Supports different logging levels (log, info, warn, error, debug, performance)
- **Production Behavior**: 
  - Informational logs are suppressed in production
  - Warnings appear with minimal information
  - Errors are always logged in full detail

This approach ensures that detailed logging is available during development while preventing excessive console output that could impact performance in production.

**Usage:**

```typescript
import logger from '../utils/logger';

// Instead of console.log:
logger.info(`Fetched ${products.length} products`);

// Critical errors are always logged:
logger.error('Failed to process order', error);

// Performance measurement:
const startTime = performance.now();
// ... operation to measure ...
logger.performance('Data processing', startTime);
```

## Extending the Store Configuration

The Store Configuration form currently supports two custom fields:

1. **Hours of Operation**: For setting the opening and closing times of the store
2. **Stripe Account ID**: For connecting the store to a payment processing account

This implementation can be extended to support additional custom fields based on project requirements. The form architecture allows for defining different sets of custom fields without modifying the core configuration component.

To add new custom fields, you would need to:
1. Define the custom type in commercetools
2. Update the form to handle the new fields
3. Add appropriate validation and transformers for the field type

This flexible approach makes the Store Configuration adaptable to different business needs across projects.
